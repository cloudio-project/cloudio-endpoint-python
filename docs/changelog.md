# [v0.1.3](https://github.com/cloudio-project/cloudio-endpoint-python/releases/tag/0.2.0) (2016-12-09)

### Features
* Added _**persistence in file**_ feature. Messages not able to be transmitted to the cloud can now be 
  stored locally on the endpoint. In contrast to the _persistance in memory_ feature, the 
  _persistence in file_ feature allows to persist data even after a power cycle.
  
  The feature can be enabled by setting the _ch.hevs.cloudio.endpoint.persistence_ parameter to _file_
  in the cloud.iO configuration file.
  
### Bug Fixes
* Attribute changes initiated from the cloud are no more thrown back to the cloud
